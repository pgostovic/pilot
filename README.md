Plan and Log for Training.

iPhone integration
------------------

The new motion co-processor in the 5s could be huge. Add the Garmin Ant+ iPhone
adapter and there are some really interesting possibilities for capturing ride
data.

On the road:
- Capture speed, cadence, hr, power, gps data

On the trainer:
- TrainerRoad style with trainer power curves for "virtual power"

Or this is cool too:
- HR strap that also converts Ant+ to bluetooth
